## :bulb: Motivation and Context
TheAndroidShow- Jetpack Compose Livestream was my hitting point. Kari Byron nailed it. It got me to add it to my watch later but Where is the XML was the tipping point. üòÇ. I instantly decided to look into what jetpack compose had over the weekend. 
I later checked the website on the 20th and realized there was a weekly challenge. 

I have been building for android for a while, so i knew this was going to be great. I found this design on [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/15292603-Weather-Conceptual-App-Design/attachments/7046975?mode=media) and decided to take the step in designing the UI with compose. I didn't know earlier weekly challenges were been put up for compose. 
i decided to give it a try. It was 2 days from the deadline and yeah i did it. 
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
Spending an entire day wrapping my head around compose for the first time, for me is really interesting.

Spending a whole day wrapping my heard around the new design -especially modifiers üòÅ and i think i love it. The preview mode is great, just slow on a bit. I love the new canvas system and the ability to make reusable components.
Something i really suffered with. This is my first time writing kotlin code which is also a great experience since i almost do everything in java.

Compose by Example was also great way i learnt it. Going through the examples and videos were of great help. Also going directly into the source to understand things was better with the help of the online docs.

I literally built this UI in less than a day looking at the number of hours i spent in designing even though ton of the Time was spent on learning how things work. 

I ‚ù§ Compose !!
